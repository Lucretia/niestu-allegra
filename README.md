# Allegra

This is a backup of the original Allegra IRC bot source code. I've no idea if this is the latest version, but it was when I grabbed it a number of years ago, the repo has disappeared from the internet, although I think jk4 may still have a copy somewhere. In fact I just found [this backup](https://github.com/ByiQ/wtf-allegra)

I didn't write this, as shown in the title, this is one Niestu's projects. I have archived it here for posterity.

I have modified GPR paths this so that it builds as is with the other archives here.

## Requirements

* niestu-jk4-common
* niestu-jk4-fs_config
* niestu-nail
* samueltardieu-postgres-ada

Download all the source archives to the same directory and then build from the allegra directory.

## Licence

GNAT Modified GPL
